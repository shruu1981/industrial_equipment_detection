Project Details
In the industrial industry, minimizing processing errors is critical for increasing revenues. To eliminate processing errors, establish a quality assurance budget, execute manual inspection activities, and assess the production process. Many companies perform the inspection procedure, but there are issues such as inconsistent accuracy, reliance on inspection people, and increasing labour expenses. 
In this notebook, we will see if the bottleneck of "manual inspection" can be eliminated by automating the inspection process with machine learning during the casting product manufacturing process. Casting is a technique in which molten metal is poured into a mold and formed into the desired shape. 
This article states the following:
burrs, shrinkage flaws, blow holes, and pinholes,Pouring metal flaws, faults in the mould material,flaws in metallurgy.
